# Indyscan
##### Hyperledger Indy Transaction explorer

--------

List and view transactions on Hyperledger Indy blockchain! Look at pretty graphs! *Yayy~*

![Indyscan](/docs/indyscan.png)


# How it works
The daemon is periodically looking for new transactions. When new transaction is found, it's
stored in MongoDB. The WebApp queries MongoDB and displays the data.

# Which networks?
The scanner and webapp can be easily configured to run against arbitrary Indy pool. As far as valid Indy pool 
genesis files are supplied, it should work!

# How difficult to run?
Very easy! Everything is dockerized! 
1. Build images locally
`./build-local.sh`.
2. Find names of your pools
`ls -l ~/.indy_client/pool`
In my case, I've already got some pools there and the command prints
```
drwxr-xr-x  4 prague  staff  128 Feb 13 14:55 PRIVATE_POOL_127.0.0.1
drwxr-xr-x  4 prague  staff  128 Feb 13 22:06 SOVRIN_MAINNET
drwxr-xr-x  4 prague  staff  128 Feb 13 21:54 SOVRIN_TESTNET
```
2. Specify names of pools you want to scan (pool names separated by commas) 
`INDY_NETWORKS="SOVRIN_MAINNET,SOVRIN_TESTNET" docker-compose up`.
3. Go to http://localhost:3000
3. Profit.

# Scanning
By default, the scanners fetches new transaction every 300ms. If none is available, it waits for few second or minutes. 
I am already running instance fo this at https://indyscan.io so be nice and let's not spam the network too much!

# Coming next
- Transaction filter
- Transaction description
- Prettier graphs with overlays
- Dynamic graphs: based on your timerange selection and transaction filter
- ... and probably much more 

# Dev
- Stack: Node, NextJS, Express
